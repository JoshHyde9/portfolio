# About me

For those who may not know, my name is Josh, but people on the internet call me Jim. I am 20 years old and was born in Echuca, Victoria but now residing on the Mornington Peninsula. I am a passionate developer and have a big emphasis on producing quality products.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I am a year 12 graduate and have enrolled myself into HarvardX's "Computer Science for Web Programming" and have completed the Computer Science section of the course and learnt a lot. I am glad to be able to use what I have learned and put that knowledge into my projects. If you're interested in working together or want to ask a question, please do not hesitate to [contact me](https://joshhyde.me/contact).
